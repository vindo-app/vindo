#Jekyll (2.5.3)

##Using the Pack
To use the Pack, we created 2 menu options, which you can find on the right of the menu. These menus can be configured in the `.codio` file.

1. **Start Jekyll** : When you come into your Project, start the Jekyll server.
1. **Preview** : This previews your app. Note the Preview menu allows you to select 'Inside Codio' or 'New Browser Tab'. 

##Accessing the application
To access your application from a browser, you can use the menu option described above. The url of your Jekyll project can be found in the `Project->Box Info` menu and will look something like this

```
https://vital-ego.box.codio.io:9500/
```

We set this up using https so it can be previewed inside a Codio Tab.

##How the Pack was prepared
This Starter Pack was built on the `Jekyll` Codio Certified Stack (Node, Grunt, MongoDB, Jekyll). The following commands were used to create the code workspace

```bash
jekyll .
npm install
```
